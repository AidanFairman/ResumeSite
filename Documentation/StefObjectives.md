The following objectives represent the personal goals that Stefana is trying to achieve.
1. Obtain experience with frontend development, most specifically focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through the use of the Angular platform and the Material UI library. 
2. Improve experience with backend development, most specifically .Net framework and SQL for database purposes. 
3. Working on both the server side and client side to gain more experience with the fullstack development overall. With the backend, the purpose is to learn how to take components piece by piece and understand them at a micro level rather than an architectural level. 
4. Gain overall experience working with a team (or partner) and communicating technical requirements as well as learning versioning control by utilizing GitHub. 
There objectives are to be met at the end of the project.
